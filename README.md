Week 3 of Getting and Cleaning Data course project

This is my run_analysis.R file

If you have the following files in your working directory, and you execute my code,
you will end up with tidy data that has both the test and training data, all of the column names,
and row names corresponding to the six activities that were tracked.

I am hoping to get time to resubmit after I debug my ddply problem which is preventing me from finishing number 5 from the assignment.
